# assembler-watch

A watch written in the assembly language. You can **set** the desired time, **display** this time that chages in real time, and **reset** it to a new value.

For now I cannot find a link to the correct online assembler simulator I used to develop the given code, but as soon as I find it, I will provide a link to it, so you can check it out.
